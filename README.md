# Applied_solutions_of_ISLP
This repository contains solutions for the exercises from "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python" by Tibshirani et al., 2023 edition. I got help from Karim (GitHub user KarimABOUSSELHAM) and want to acknowledge him for providing guidance and code examples through his repository ISLP-applied-solutions.
The book is designed to help anyone understand data analysis, especially as data collection grows in almost every field. It explains important topics in statistical learning in a simple and less technical way. The first edition, with examples in R (ISLR), was released in 2013, and the second edition came out in 2021. It has been translated into several languages including Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Russian, and Vietnamese. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023. Each chapter includes a lab that shows the concepts in either R or Python.
The exercises and solutions in this repository cover many topics, including linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more.
